# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001 — IDE support before Designer

Accepted. A Matisse-like designer is built only after normal Flutter development works well in NetBeans.

## ADR-002 — Flutter/Dart SDK remains external

Accepted. The plugin discovers and validates a user-installed SDK instead of bundling one.

## ADR-003 — Process/tooling abstractions are NetBeans-independent

Accepted. SDK, analysis and run modules contain no NetBeans UI dependencies. This improves testability and keeps later IDE integrations thin.

## ADR-004 — Designer is a separate module

Accepted. The designer may consume stable services but may not become a prerequisite for standard Dart/Flutter editing and execution.

## ADR-005 — Dart semantic services use the NetBeans LSP client

Accepted. The plugin launches the SDK's Dart Language Server with standard LSP streams and registers a MIME-scoped NetBeans `LanguageServerProvider`. NetBeans owns ordinary protocol framing and editor adapters; the plugin owns SDK resolution, process isolation, project working directory, language-id mapping, and project-close termination. Narrow RELEASE300 compatibility transforms advertise the already-implemented `workspace.applyEdit` capability in the first outgoing `initialize` frame and adapt correlated, resolvable Dart completion items. The completion bridge stores the exact original `data` and `textEdit` JSON in a private Base64 envelope, hides the top-level edit, and restores both before Dart receives `completionItem/resolve`; Dart then contributes `additionalTextEdits` instead of recreating the main edit. Unmatched frames remain byte-for-byte unchanged. Non-resolvable items retain their `textEdit`, although a frame containing a transformed sibling is reserialized. Dart's `resolved.command` path for some part-file and multi-file imports remains unsupported by NetBeans 30's standard `CompletionProviderImpl`; diagnostic Quick Fixes provide the supported fallback.
